# Abstract

Physical and online social interactions broadly decline in strength with geographic distance, and intra-community interaction strength often appears to correlate with pre-defined geographic administrative boundaries. These factors suggest that there are strong regional influences on social interactions, particularly given online social interactions are not directly restricted by distance. Regional identities between constituent countries within the UK are frequently studied from the context of structured surveys and census data, with language seen as a defining feature of these identities. In our work, we consider the exploration of semantic interaction strength, building a comparative analysis of corpora related to regions within the UK, determining shared semantic similarities between them. Building on this analysis, we establish the strength of regional Scottish, Welsh, English, and British identities within each region, using emergent properties of a large language model. We find that distinct groups emerge particularly in the South East and North East of England, while Scottish regional identity appears to be more distinct from England and Britishness compared with the Welsh identity.

# Introduction

Social interaction is typically studied in the context of mobility, using data sources like Census or transport records, where physical movement is restricted by distance and ease of connectivity between two locations [@rae2009;@titheridge2009]. In contrast to this, social interaction has also been studied using phone call data [@sobolevsky2013], and social media networks [@lengyel2015], where the spatial and temporal bounds of connectivity between two locations does not restrict interactions. Despite this however, many studies have found that geographic identities within communities still persist in these networks, with interaction strength influenced by both the geographic distance between them and their regional identity [@arthur2019;@ratti2010].

Social media also presents rich semantic information regarding locations through text associated with geotagged social media posts. Comparative analysis of corpora associated with geotagged locations similarly exhibit regional cohesion [@yin2017a]; for example, tweets from the North East of England are statistically different compared with the South [@arthur2019].

In the context of political science, regional identities have been well studied through the use of structured survey or census data [@griffiths2022;@haesly2005;@llamas2014], which may provide explanation into the
inherent geographic restrictions that still appear with social media interactions. Language itself can be a strong indicator of regional identity [@haesly2005;@llamas2009;@llamas2014], and past work has considered the regional variation in language that exists within social media networks [@huang2016;@goncalves2014;@perez2019;@arthur2019].

Our paper explores the similarity of corpora with respect to locational mentions taken directly from social media text, without relying on geotagged metadata. This approach offers an alternative perspective for the analysis of social interaction, built directly from the semantic information associated with locations, rather than the location associated with social media users themselves. Collective semantic information from social media embeds the regional identity of locations across a continuous spectrum, allowing for the direct comparison between these identities and their relationships. Additionally, we consider that regional identities may be identified from text, and extracted through the use of emergent capabilities of large language models.

# Literature Review

Social interaction is a common theme in geographic research, typically focussing on the physical movement of individuals and populations to assume a level of inherent connectivity between distinct locations. These physical interactions are restricted by geographic distance [@miller2018;@patterson2015], following Tobler's first law of geography [@tobler1970] and the 'distance decay' effect [@taylor1983]. However, when examining administrative regions that exist within the United Kingdom, research has found that physical social interactions often correlated with these artificial boundaries [@ratti2010], suggesting that regional identities persist through these interactive networks, which disrupt the effect of distance.

Early research suggested that ease of communication regardless of distance meant that social ties were likely to become less geographically restricted [@cairncross1997], this assertion has however largely been found to be untrue. Many studies have found that despite the removal of this restriction in telecommunication, cohesive communities still persist, and interactions are broadly still affected by both geographic distance, and administrative boundaries [@onnela2011;@sobolevsky2013]. New forms of data provide social interactions through online social media networks like Twitter, which contribute geotagged interactions between users [@takhteyev2012;@arthur2019;@scellato2010]. These works similarly find that user interactions on social media are restricted by geographic distance and a 'distance decay' effect [@arthur2019;@stephens2015], and broadly conform with the arbitrary administrative boundaries that exist within geographic space [@arthur2019;@yin2017a].

The presence of these two geographic restrictions in social interactions in telecommunication and social media networks suggest that additional influencing factors are present.

## Regional identity

The concept of regional identities within populations has been well studied from the context of political research [@griffiths2022], particularly in relation to the shared national identity that becomes apparent within constituent countries in the United Kingdom [@haesly2005]. Methods for quantifying broad perspectives of regional identities have typically focussed on the use of surveys, questioning individuals beliefs that they belong to a particular nation.

When considering both Scottish and Welsh identities, @haesly2005 observe that in both cases, respondents display strong national pride and emphasise their distinction from England. The overall level of pride however was found to be stronger in Scotland, rooted in the richer history that creates a more distinct nation compared with Wales. Other studies have also found that people from North East England exhibit a strong sense of regional identity and emphasise their distinction from the rest of England, built on a historical sense of regional pride [@middleton2008;@nayak2016]. The strength of national identities may be quantified through the use of Relative Territorial Identity (RTI) surveys, which asks respondents to rank their national identities on a scale ranging from 'not at all' to 'very strongly' [@griffiths2022]. @henderson2021 identify English nationalism by questioning a persons beliefs whether they are British or English. Similarly, work has identified a strong sense of Scottish identity from questioning whether a person feels more Scottish than British [@carman2014].

Many works emphasise the importance of language in defining regional identities [@haesly2005;@llamas2009;@llamas2014]. The Scottish identity, for instance, is strongly associated with a sub-dialect of English known as 'Scottish English' which includes words and phrases that are uncommon outside of Scotland [@stuart-smith2008], while language in the North East of England is also considered a defining feature of its regional identity, despite having no formal language [@nayak2016]. Language has also been used to define

Regional variations in linguistic characteristics are often quantified from a statistical lexical perspective, identifying regional differences in common words on Twitter [@huang2016;@eisenstein2014;@goncalves2014;@goncalves2014;@arthur2019], or identifying dialects from active participation methods [@clopper2016]. While few explicitly consider the link between regional identity and language on social media, @arthur2019 examined lexicons associated with cohesive regions in England and Wales generated from an analysis of social networks, establishing a cosine similarity measure between them. Results indicated that the Welsh lexicon appeared the most dissimilar to all other regions, while Northern English regions were more similar to each other compared with Southern regions, which conforms with observations made in survey focussed regional identity research [@haesly2005]. Alternatively, @huang2016 analyse geotagged Twitter data lexical alternations to establish hierarchical dialect regions within the US, establishing a clear North South divide, which conforms with cultural geography findings.

NOTE: @russ

In our work we aim to generate a measure of regional identity through an examination of text associated with place names extracted from comments on the social media website Reddit. While past work has examined cohesion within regions from the perspective of social media networks, or by examining lexicons associated with geotagged social media messages, we examine regional variations derived from text associated with directly embedded place names. Unlike using geotags, which mean linguistic features relate solely to a person posting from within a location, our data captures any comment than mentions a location in context; both from people living within the mentioned location, and people from outside mentioning them. This means that we capture broad opinionated regional identities, built from a variety of contexts, rather than from a just from the point of a view of examining the dialect of a location.

Instead of using lexical approaches, we consider the ability of large language models to embed contextual semantic information from text when generating high dimensional text representations [@devlin2019], which is not possible with count-based lexicons. We believe this property is important in this research, given the meaning of words, especially in informal, region specific language, is highly context dependent.

[Reddit](https://reddit.com) is a public discussion, news aggregation social network, among the top 20 most visited websites in the United Kingdom. As of 2020, Reddit had around 430 million active monthly users, comparable to the number of Twitter users [@murphy2019;@statista2022]. Reddit is divided into separate independent _subreddits_ each with specific topics of discussion, where _users_ may submit _posts_ which each have dedicated nested conversation threads that users can add _comments_ to. Subreddits cover a wide range of topics, and in the interest of geography, they also act as forums for the discussion of local places. The [United Kingdom subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom) acts as a general hub for related topics, notably including a list of smaller and more specific related subreddits. This list provides a 'Places' section, a collection of local British subreddits, ranging in scale from country level (`/r/England`), regional (`/r/thenorth`, `/r/Teeside`), to cities (`/r/Manchester`) and small towns (`/r/Alnwick`). In total there are 213 subreddits that relate to 'places' within the United Kingdom^[https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/wiki/british_subreddits]. For each subreddit, every single historic comment was retrieved using the [Pushshift](https://pushshift.io/) Reddit archive [@baumgartner2020]. In total {all_comments['count'][0]:,} comments were extracted, submitted by {all_comments['n_authors'][0]:,} unique users, between {all_comments['first_utc'][0]} and {all_comments['last_utc'][0]}.
"""
    )
)
```

We extracted and geolocated all place names in this collection of comments using a custom-built geoparsing pipeline. To identify place names, we used a BERT transformer-based NER model trained on the WNUT 2017 dataset [@derczynski2017], available on the [HuggingFace Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/cjber/reddit-ner-place_names). We then implemented a disambiguation methodology using contextual place names and two gazetteers to geolocate place names; [OS Open Names](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-names) and 'natural' location types from the [Gazetteer of British Place Names](https://gazetteer.org.uk/). Processed comments consist of a collection of geolocated place names, alongside their natural language context sentence.

From this dataset, we retained any location mentioned by over 250 unique authors and with more than 500 context words. For each location we then took a random sample of 5,000 comments, ensuring each was represented equally, while also reducing the computational load of future processing.

## Similarity of Regional Corpora

Comparing the similarity between two or more distinct texts first relies on an appropriate method for processing the text into a numerical format. For each location we obtained a corpus of comments, consisting of sentences where each location is mentioned. These were then processed into a single vector, reflecting the semantic information attributed with locations. Typically, a TF-IDF approach is used to generate document embeddings [@daniel2007], however we found comparative analysis between embeddings did not always provide insightful information. Each vector shared similar properties, giving cosine similarities which did not result in any distinct variation between locations. This is likely a problem with the language between locations sharing similar properties, meaning the more nuanced semantic information is not captured through a TF-IDF method.

We therefore extracted embeddings from a deep neural network called a transformer. Unlike TF-IDF or simpler neural network models, transformers are able to use contextual information to generate word embeddings, meaning the same word in two different contexts will not share the exact same vector, capturing different embedded semantic information [@vaswani2017]. Additionally, transformers are _pre-trained_ on a large corpus of text, meaning general information regarding the English language is already embedded within the model, allowing for improved understanding of semantic information. These core features mean that embeddings generated from transformers are likely to capture information that allows for more the accurate comparative analysis. We generated embeddings using the `all-mpnet-base-v2` model from the `sentence-transformers` library in Python [@reimers2019]. Unlike a standard 'BERT'-like transformer, this library implements modifications to base models that more appropriately captures semantic information in their output embeddings.

Before calculating embeddings we first masked every mention of a location with a generic token 'PLACE', this ensured that when analysing embeddings, no explicit geographic information was captured accidentally. For example, London and the South East may mention matching locations frequently in each of their comments because they are geographically close. Once embeddings were generated for every comment in each regional corpus, the mean for each corpus was generated, giving a vector 768 decimal values for each UK region.

With a single vector for each region, we first calculated K-Means clusters to determine whether distinct groupings of regions could be identified across the UK. To visualise these clusters we used a PCA decomposition to reduce the dimensionality from 768 down to 2 dimensions. Finally, we calculated the cosine similarity between each and every location vector.

## Zero-Shot regional identities

Building on the concept of relative territorial identity measures, we construct a methodology to examine relative regional identity strength based on the semantic information embedded within comments. Semantic information is expected to capture both explicit information contributed by users; for example stating 'London is a British city', in addition to implicit semantic information that exists within language. For example the phrase 'bonnie Scotland' may suggest a strong regional identity due to the inclusion of Scottish slang^[See 'Scottish English' or 'Scots'; [@stuart-smith2008]].

To identify regional identities through semantic information, we build on the emergent properties of large language models, which enable a task known as 'Zero-Shot Classification'. This allows models to predict a class that was not seen during training, by generating a prompt that contains the labels required. For our task an example prompt may be constructed as follows:

```
Classify the following input text into one of the following four categories:
[British, English, Scottish, Welsh]

Input Text: I feel more Welsh than British.
```

The output would then be given as a sequence of confidence values for each label:

```
'labels': ['Welsh', 'British', 'English', 'Scottish']
'scores': [0.9902838468551636,
          0.007325825747102499,

@fig-clusters shows K Means clusters for transformer embeddings decomposed into two dimensions with $k=5$, indicating regional corpora that share similar semantic properties. Notably Scotland, the North East, and West Midlands each appear as single values in unique clusters, suggesting semantically distinct corpora from the rest of the country. There are two further clusters which encompass the South East of England (Cluster 1), and the rest of England and Wales (Cluster 3). @fig-clusters (B) reveals that clusters do broadly appear to reflect distance-restricted geographic properties, while also capturing some divergences from this where neighbouring administrative regions appear in distinct clusters.

```{python}
# | label: fig-similarity
# | fig-cap: "Cosine similarity between each and every location related transformer vector embedding. Green highlights indicate the highest value in each row, while red indicates the lowest value in each row."

from paper.figures import plot_similarity

plot_similarity(region_embeddings)
plt.show()
```

Comparing the cosine similarity of the mean embeddings relating to each region on @fig-similarity, we can more directly observe intra-region cohesion. The North West has the overall highest levels of cosine similarity with each other region, with comparatively high similarity with each other region. Lower similarities occur in regions like Wales, the Midlands, and Yorkshire, generally caused by lower overall similarities with London, the South East and East of England. In particular, the South Eastern region of England (Cluster 1 on @fig-clusters), has low overall similarity with all other regions, excluding the North West. These observations are indicative of a semantic divide between the North and South of England, a feature commonly observed from the context of ... [refs].

With respect Wales we can see that despite having a weak similarity to the South East, Wales shares higher similarities with the rest of England. This is not the case with Scotland however, where similarities are overall lower with England. Finally, the North East has the lowest overall similarity of any region in Britain, driven primarily by the very low similarity with the South East of England cluster. This observation conforms with the strong regional identity that has been observed in the North East from a qualitative perspective [@middleton2008;@nayak2016], and quantitative analysis of Tweet contents [@arthur2019]. Interestingly, despite bordering Scotland, the North East does not share the high similarity found between the North West and Scotland.

## Regional Identities

@fig-identity shows the distribution of regional identities identified through our zero-shot classification methodology. Across each region, the 'English' identity is always lower than 'British', suggesting that regions within England typically identify more strongly with the United Kingdom than solely England. Unlike English regions however, both Scotland and Wales identify most strongly with their respective nationalities. While the Welsh identity is reasonably weak, below the weakest British identity in the UK, the Scottish identity is by far the most strong of any identity across every region.

These results mirror those of past work considering regional identities through the use of structured surveys. Scottish and Welsh identities are both considered stronger than a British identity within these countries, but the Scottish identity is much stronger than the Welsh identity [@haesly2005].

```{python}
# | label: fig-identity
# | fig-cap: "Zero Shot classification of each corpus into regional identities; [B]ritish, [E]nglish, [S]cottish, [W]elsh. Values show mean confidence value across each comment, lines indicate 99% confidence intervals. Descending order by [B]ritish confidence."

from paper.figures import plot_zero_shot


plot_zero_shot(Paths.PROCESSED / "places_zero_shot.parquet")
```

To identify why the model makes certain predictions, we input a selection of phrases to identify the model confidence outputs, shown on Table \ref{tbl-interpret}. The model makes some interesting choices depending on the sentiment of the input text. For example if we input 'I love Scotland!' the model labels the text as Scottish, while if we change the text to 'I hate Scotland!' the model labels the text as British, with similar results of Wales. These results perhaps suggest that the model understands that personal national sentiment is typically more likely to be positive. 'I hate England!' and 'I love England!' are both considered British, however.

```{python}
# | output: asis

from paper.tables import tbl_interpret

print(
    tbl_interpret().to_latex(
        hrules=True,
        label="tbl-interpret",
        caption="Model response to strong national preferences.",
        environment="longtable",
    )
)
```

Unusual patterns emerge if we select particular cities; hating Aberdeen is more likely to be Scottish, while hating Edinburgh is more likely to be British. Hating 'the North' is more likely to be British, while hating 'the South' is more likely to the Scottish. Most interestingly, the model appears mostly reluctant to label any text explicitly talking about English locations as English, and prefers to use British. This perhaps reflects the overall general national identity that is associated with England as a country within the UK, compared with Scotland and Wales.

# Conclusion

Our paper demonstrates the ability to compare Reddit comments relating to locations within regions across the UK, using document embeddings generated from a transformer neural network. Instead of focussing on physical interactions between people or geotagged social media interactions, our work identifies relationships between regions through their semantic footprint, and analysing each corpus computationally allows for direct comparisons between cities through clustering and cosine similarity. We additionally demonstrate the ability to capture zero-shot classifications of regional identities through emergent properties of large language models.

Our analysis reveals distinct clusters which largely reflect geographic proximity of locations, however, interesting anomalies emerge, with the West Midlands and the North East. The South East in particular appears distinct from the rest of the UK, while Wales shares a stronger identity with the UK compared with Scotland.

The information generated through our work presents an alternative view of relationships between cities that are not captured by existing data sources, all of which rely on explicit geographic coordinate information. Instead, we build similarities and clusters directly from the semantic information that exists within their respective corpora. Unlike traditional data, which captures objective social interactions between regions, the deviations from the restriction of geographic distance between several cities in our work appears to reflect the more subjective language that shapes the cultural and perceived identity of regions, and the relationships between them.

While our work enables the direct numerical comparison between city-based corpora, it cannot explain the similarities and dissimilarities between them. Additional work may explore the use of topic-modelling to identify shared topics between locations, and differences in the sentiment towards these topics may explain dissimilarity.

NOTES: Our results appear to broadly conform with general studies using both mobility data, survey, and geotagged social media which suggest there is a strong regional identity with Scotland, but less so with Wales. We additionally identify regions within the UK that also appear to have some separation, like the North East, and quantitatively identify regions with the strongest overall connection with the rest of the country; the North West. See 'More Scottish than British' [@carman2014].
