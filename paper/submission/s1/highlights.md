## Highlights

* Large language models can be leveraged to extract vernacular knowledge of places

* A mathematical representation of the vernacular knowledge of places derived from text-based data is introduced in the form of semantic footprints

* Semantic footprints exhibit geographically cohesive patterns; which correlate broadly with the national boundaries of Great Britain

* London, Wales, and Scotland emerge as the most distinct semantic spatial clusters
