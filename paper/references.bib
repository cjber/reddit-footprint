  abstract = {The capabilities for visualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic information systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the ``spatial'' aspects of the data. The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ``outliers,'' as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

This paper presents a new methodology to study social interaction within and between social-geographic regions, and then applies the methodology to a case study of England and Wales. We use a social network, built from geo-located Twitter data, to identify contiguous geographical regions with a shared social identity and then investigate patterns of communication within and between them. In contrast to other approaches (e.g. using phone call data records or online friendship networks), use of Twitter data provides message contents as well as social connections. This allows us to investigate not only the volume of communication between locations, but also the sentiment and vocabulary used in the messages. For example, our case study shows: a significant dialect difference between England and Wales; that regions tend to be more positive about themselves than about others, with the South being more `self-regarding' than the North; and that people talk politics much more between regions than within. This study demonstrates how social media can be used to quantify regional identity and inter-region communications and sentiment, exposing these previously hard-to-observe geographic concepts to analysis.},

  abstract = {Social networks can shape many aspects of social and economic activity: migration and trade, job-seeking, innovation, consumer preferences and sentiment, public health, social mobility, and more. In turn, social networks themselves are associated with geographic proximity, historical ties, political boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the unavailability of large-scale and representative data on social connectedness between individuals or geographic regions has posed a challenge for empirical research on social networks. More recently, a body of such research has begun to emerge using data on social connectedness from online social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. To date, most of these research projects have been built on anonymized administrative microdata from Facebook, typically by working with coauthor teams that include Facebook employees. However, there is an inherent limit to the number of researchers that will be able to work with social network data through such collaborations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social connectedness at the US county level. Our Social Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on Facebook, the global online social networking service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook friendship links between every county-pair in the United States, and between every US county and every foreign country. Given Facebook's scale as well as the relative representativeness of Facebook's user body, these data provide the first comprehensive measure of friendship networks at a national level.},

Building on existing literature on territorial stigmatisation that either focuses on macro-scale uses and effects of territorial stigmatisation or micro-scale ethnographic studies of effects, we develop a novel approach that captures the diverse voices that engage in the discourse of denigration by tracing the use of the word and hashtag ``shithole'' on the social media platform Twitter in order to examine who is engaged in the stigmatising discourse, the types of place that are stigmatised and the responses to stigmatised places. Using a robust data set, we highlight two key findings. First, the majority of tweets were aimed at places where the tweeter was not from, a form of othering consistent with how territories are stigmatised by those in positions of power such as policymakers, politicians and journalists. Second, we note that an important and gendered minority of tweets can be characterised by a ``cry for help'' and powerlessness, where the stigma is aimed at their own places. We offer an interpretive lens through which to understand and frame these minoritarian voices by engaging with theories of abjection that allow us to see how minoritarian voices relate to place.},

This paper focuses on urban areas of interest (UAOI), a concept that provides functional definitions of a city's spatial structure. Traditional sources of social data can rarely capture these aspects at scale while spatial information on the city alone does not capture how the population values different parts of the city and in different ways. Hence, we leverage volunteered geographic information (VGI) to overcome some of the limits of traditional sources in providing urban structural and functional insights. We use a special type of VGI{\textemdash}metadata from geotagged Flickr images{\textemdash}to identify UAOIs and exploit their temporal and spatial attributes. To do this, we propose a methodological strategy that combines hierarchical density-based spatial clustering for applications with noise and the `{$\alpha$}-shape' algorithm to quantify the dynamics of UAOIs in Inner London for a period 2013{\textendash}2015 and develop an innovative visualisation of UAOI profiles from which UAOI dynamics can be explored. Our results expand and improve upon the previous literature on this topic and provide a useful reference for urban practitioners who might wish to include more timely information when making decisions.},

Our model is robust to unpredictable changes in Twitter's sampling rate, and provides a probabilistic characterization of the relationship of macro-scale linguistic influence to a set of demographic and geographic predictors. The results of this analysis offer support for prior arguments that focus on geographical proximity and population size. However, demographic similarity {\textendash} especially with regard to race {\textendash} plays an even more central role, as cities with similar racial demographics are far more likely to share linguistic influence. Rather than moving towards a single unified ``netspeak'' dialect, language evolution in computer-mediated communication reproduces existing fault lines in spoken American English.},

  abstract = {Cognitive regions and places are notoriously difficult to represent in geographic information science and systems. The exact delineation of cognitive regions is challenging insofar as borders are vague, membership within the regions varies non-monotonically, and raters cannot be assumed to assess membership consistently and homogeneously. In a study published in this journal in 2014, researchers devised a novel grid-based task in which participants rated the membership of individual cells in a given region and contrasted this approach to a standard boundary-drawing task. Specifically, the authors assessed the vague cognitive regions ofNorthern CaliforniaandSouthern California. The boundary between these cognitive regions was found to have variable width, and region membership peaked not at the most northern or southern cells but at substantially less extreme latitudes. The authors thus concluded that region membership is about attitude, not just latitude. In the present work, we reproduce this study by approaching it from a computationalfourth-paradigmperspective, i.e., by the synthesis of high volumes of heterogeneous data from various sources. We compare the regions which we identify to those from the human-participants study of 2014, identifying differences and commonalities. Our results show a significant positive correlation to those in the original study. Beyond the extracted regions themselves, we compare and contrast the empirical and analytical approaches of these two methods, one a conventional human-participants study and the other an application of increasingly popular data-synthesis-driven research methods in GIScience.},

Many researchers now use Relative Territorial Identity (RTI) as an alternative. However, the potential limitations of this approach are yet to be explored. I provide that examination here. After reiterating the limits of the Linz-Moreno question, I use data for England, Scotland, and Wales to highlight that RTI has similar issues to the Linz-Moreno (linearity, intensity, dual identity). Following this, I use data from Flanders and Wallonia to demonstrate the limits of conflating attachment and identity when using RTI, as respondents treat the concepts differently. Overall, these results highlight the limits of existing measures of relative identity, which have important implications for how researchers examine substate territories.},

  abstract = {Geolocation prediction is vital to geospatial applications like localised search and local event detection. Predominately, social media geolocation models are based on full text data, including common words with no geospatial dimension (e.g. today) and noisy strings (tmrw), potentially hampering prediction and leading to slower/more memory-intensive models. In this paper, we focus on finding location indicative words (LIWs) via feature selection, and establishing whether the reduced feature set boosts geolocation accuracy. Our results show that an information gain ratiobased approach surpasses other methods at LIW selection, outperforming state-of-the-art geolocation prediction methods by 10.6\% in accuracy and reducing the mean and median of prediction error distance by 45km and 209km, respectively, on a public dataset. We further formulate notions of prediction confidence, and demonstrate that performance is even higher in cases where our model is more confident, striking a trade-off between accuracy and coverage. Finally, the identified LIWs reveal regional language differences, which could be potentially useful for lexicographers.},

This paper investigates linking fine-grained locations in Foursquare comments. We demonstrate that the focal location, i.e., the location that a comment is posted on, provides rich contexts for the linking task. To exploit such information, we represent the Foursquare data in a graph, which includes locations, comments, and their relations. A probabilistic model named FocalLink is proposed to estimate the probability that a user mentions a location when commenting on a focal location, by following different kinds of relations. Experimental results show that FocalLink is consistently superior under different collective linking settings.},

Users seek to ascribe appropriate semantics to images, though bulk-uploading and bulk-tagging may introduce bias. Between 0.5-2\% of tags associated with georeferenced images analyzed describe city core areas generically, while 70\% of all georeferenced images analyzed include specific place name tags, with place names at the granularity of city names being by far the most common. Using Flickr metadata, it is possible not only to describe the use of the term Downtown across the USA, but also to explore the borders of city center neighborhoods at the level of individual cities, whilst accounting for bias by the use of tag profiles.},

Attempts have been made to identify urban functional regions using high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images and extensive geodata. However, the research scale and throughput have also been limited by the accessibility of HSR remote sensing data. Recently, big geo-data are becoming increasingly popular for urban studies since research is still accessible and objective with regard to the use of these data. This study aims to build a novel framework to provide an alternative solution for sensing urban spatial structure and discovering urban functional regions based on emerging geo-data {\textendash} points of interest (POIs) data and an embedding learning method in the natural language processing (NLP) field. We started by constructing the intraurban functional corpus using a centercontext pairs-based approach. A word embeddings representation model for training that corpus was used to extract multiprototype vectors in the second step, and the last step aggregated the functional parcels based on an introduced spatial clustering method, hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). The clustering results suggested that our proposed framework used in this study is capable of discovering the utilization of urban space with a reasonable level of accuracy. The limitation and potential improvement of the proposed framework are also discussed.},

From the one-year Twitter corpus, we extract lexical characteristics for twitter users by summarizing the frequencies of a set of lexical alternations that each user has used. We spatially aggregate and smooth each lexical characteristic to derive county-based linguistic variables, from which orthogonal dimensions are extracted using the principal component analysis (PCA). Finally a regionalization method is used to discover hierarchical dialect regions with using the PCA components. The regionalization results reveal interesting linguistic regional variations in the U.S. The discovered regions not only confirm past research findings in the literature but also provide new insights and a more detailed understanding of very recent linguistic patterns in the U.S.},

We also consider the geographical extension of communication triangles and we show that communication triangles are not only composed of geographically adjacent nodes but that they may extend over large distances. This last property is not captured by the existing models of geographical networks and in a last section we propose a new model that reproduces the observed property.

Such data can be mined to provide planners, marketers and researchers with useful information about activities and opinions across time and space. However, in their raw form, textual data are still difficult to analyse coherently and Twitter streams pose particular interpretive challenges because they are restricted to just 140 characters. This paper explores the use of an unsupervised learning algorithm to classify geo-tagged Tweets from Inner London recorded during typical weekdays throughout 2013 into a small number of groups, following extensive text cleaning techniques. Our classification identifies 20 distinctive and interpretive topic groupings, which represent key types of Tweets, from describing activities or informal conversations between users, to the use of check-in applets. Our motivation is to use the classification to demonstrate how the nature of the content posted on Twitter varies according to the characteristics of places and users. Topics and attitudes expressed through Tweets are found to vary substantially across Inner London, and by time of day. Some observed variations in behaviour on Twitter can be attributed to the inferred demographic and socio-economic characteristics of users, but place and local activities can also exert a considerable influence. Overall, the classification was found to provide a valuable framework for investigating the content and coverage of Twitter usage across Inner London.},

For decades, spatial scientists have researched place connectivity, applications, and metrics. The growing popularity of social media provides a new data stream where spatial social interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable, and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a global multi-scale place connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a spatiotemporal-continuous and easy-to-implement measurement. The multi-scale PCI, demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10\% penetration in the US population) and Facebook's social connectedness index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found that PCI has a strong boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity knowledge, exemplified with two applications: (1) modeling the spatial spread of COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic and (2) modeling hurricane evacuation destination choice. The methodological and contextual knowledge of PCI, together with the open-sourced PCI datasets at various geographic levels, are expected to support research fields requiring knowledge in human spatial interactions.},

  abstract = {Language and Identities offers a broad survey of our current state of knowledge on the connections between variability in language use and the construction, negotiation, maintenance and performance of identities at different levels - individual, group, regional and national. It brings together over 20 specially commissioned chapters, written by distinguished international scholars, on a range of topics around the language/identity nexus. The collection deals sequentially with identities at various levels, both social and personal. Using detailed, empirical evidence, the chapters illustrate how the multi-layered, dynamic nature of identities is realised through linguistic behaviour. Several chapters in the volume focus on contexts in which we might expect to observe a foregrounding of factors involved in the definition and delimitation of self and other: for example, cases in which identities may be disputed, changing, blurred, peripheral, or imposed. Such a focus on complex contexts allows clearer insight into the identity-making and -marking functions of language. The collection approaches these topics from a range of perspectives, with contributions from sociolinguists, sociophoneticians, linguistic anthropologists, clinical linguists and forensic linguists.},

A second aim is to track changes in real time, which we do by comparing our findings to those of the 1950s-era Survey of English Dialects (SED; Orton, 1962). We improve upon previous dialectological work by paying careful attention to the phonemic status of mergers and splits: In our contemporary data, we do this by asking subjects if they have a phonemic contrast; in the SED data, we do this by superimposing the isoglosses for individual phones. We find evidence for both stability and change; we document previously unverified patterns. Perhaps most importantly, we identify a number of directions for future research.},

While our social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it has been impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the nature of this restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities. These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and spatial constraints.},

This paper examines how the key concepts of PPAs and ASs have evolved, how they have been applied, what issues need to be resolved, and potential areas for future research. The review begins with the main theoretical developments influencing the applied use of these methods, and continues with a categorization of the literature across three dimensions {\textemdash} research domain, methods of calculation and application purpose. We find that the methods have been used not only in the core originating fields of travel behaviour and transport geography, but also in health, criminology and demography, and are growing fastest in health. The methods have been applied to a number of purposes with applications to accessibility the most common and the fastest growing. Demonstrated interest in these methods, along with the technologies and data to facilitate them, suggests a bright future for the use of PPAs and ASs in the social sciences.},

The irruption of Social Media and its microblogging services has produced an unprecedented wealth of content, mainly informal text generated by users, opening new opportunities for linguists to extend their studies of language variation. Previous work on automatic detection of regionalisms depended mostly on word frequencies. In this work, we present a novel metric based on Information Theory that incorporates user frequency. We tested this metric on a corpus of Argentinian Spanish tweets in two ways: via manual annotation of the relevance of the retrieved terms, and also as a feature selection method for geolocation of users. In either case, our metric outperformed other techniques based solely in word frequency, suggesting that measuring the amount of users that produce a word is informative. This tool has helped lexicographers discover several unregistered words of Argentinian Spanish, as well as different meanings assigned to registered words.},

This is somewhat surprising given the potential of such approaches to shed light on the spatial characteristics associated with the movement of people and goods. Despite the attention of a select number of researchers whose contributions have been significant, however, the subject matter remains underdeveloped and the full potential of spatial interaction data remains largely unrealised. Therefore, this paper represents an attempt to popularise the use of flow mapping within a contemporary GIS, with a view to aiding and enhancing decision support at a range of different spatial scales. It discusses advances in flow mapping, proposes an approach to mapping a large migration matrix from the United Kingdom's 2001 census, and considers the ways in which this can add value to the understanding of geographical patterns of residential mobility. Subsequently, it considers possible dissemination methods via new developments in webbased geospatial technologies before offering some general principles and identifying future challenges. The findings indicate that it is now entirely feasible to map large spatial interaction datasets with common GIS software, that this has the benefit of producing instant, query-led information, and that the knowledge derived from this could be used to inform all kinds of local, regional and national policy formulation and evaluation.},

This paper proposes a novel, fine-grained approach to regional delineation, based on analyzing networks of billions of individual human transactions. Given a geographical area and some measure of the strength of links between its inhabitants, we show how to partition the area into smaller, non-overlapping regions while minimizing the disruption to each person's links. We tested our method on the largest non-Internet human network, inferred from a large telecommunications database in Great Britain. Our partitioning algorithm yields geographically cohesive regions that correspond remarkably well with administrative regions, while unveiling unexpected spatial structures that had previously only been hypothesized in the literature. We also quantify the effects of partitioning, showing for instance that the effects of a possible secession of Wales from Great Britain would be twice as disruptive for the human network than that of Scotland.},

The potential of these services as the basis to gather statistics and exploit information about user behavior is appealing and, as a consequence, the number of applications developed for these purposes has been soaring. At the same time, users are now willing to share information about their location, allowing for the study of the role of geographic distance in social ties. In this paper we present a graph analysis based approach to study social networks with geographic information and new metrics to characterize how geographic distance affects social structure. We apply our analysis to four large-scale OSN datasets: our results show that there is a vast portion of users with short-distance links and that clusters of friends are often geographically close. In addition, we demonstrate that different social networking services exhibit different geo-social properties: OSNs based mainly on location-advertising largely foster local ties and clusters, while services used mainly for news and content sharing present more connections and clusters on longer distances. The results of this work can be exploited to improve many classes of systems and a potential vast number of applications, as we illustrate by means of some practical examples.},

Although it is an unsupervised learning to clustering in pattern recognition and machine learning, the k-means algorithm and its extensions are always influenced by initializations with a necessary number of clusters a priori. That is, the k-means algorithm is not exactly an unsupervised clustering method. In this paper, we construct an unsupervised learning schema for the k-means algorithm so that it is free of initializations without parameter selection and can also simultaneously find an optimal number of clusters. That is, we propose a novel unsupervised k-means (Uk-means) clustering algorithm with automatically finding an optimal number of clusters without giving any initialization and parameter selection. The computational complexity of the proposed U-k-means clustering algorithm is also analyzed. Comparisons between the proposed U-k-means and other existing methods are made. Experimental results and comparisons actually demonstrate these good aspects of the proposed U-kmeans clustering algorithm.},

Here we use an extended set of countries and clustering indices to quantify overlaps, providing ample additional evidence for these observations using phone data from countries of various scales across Europe, Asia, and Africa: France, the UK, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, and Ivory Coast. In our analysis we use the known approach of partitioning country-wide networks, and an additional iterative partitioning of each of the first level communities into subcommunities, revealing that cohesiveness and matching of official regions can also be observed on a second level if spatial resolution of the data is high enough. The method has possible policy implications on the definition of the borderlines and sizes of administrative regions.},

  abstract = {This paper compares the social properties of Twitter users' networks with the spatial proximity of the networks. Using a comprehensive analysis of network density and network transitivity we found that the density of networks and the spatial clustering depends on the size of the network; smaller networks are more socially clustered and extend a smaller physical distance and larger networks are physically more dispersed with less social clustering. Additionally, Twitter networks are more effective at transmitting information at the local level. For example, local triadic connections are more than twice as likely to be transitive than those extending more than 500 km. This implies that not only is distance important to the communities developed in online social networks, but scale is extremely pertinent to the nature of these networks. Even as technologies such as Twitter enable a larger volume of interaction between spaces, these interactions do not invent completely new social and spatial patterns, but instead replicate existing arrangements.},

Family motives appear just as important, even at distances {$\geq$}100 km, with the desire to live closer to non-resident family/friends being the most frequently cited family submotive. Estimated propensities to undertake employment and educational-related migration fit very closely to predictions of human capital models of migration, being highest among young, residentially flexible and highly educated individuals. Migrants citing family-related motives are disproportionately drawn from midlife and later-life phases, with family shown to be a key motive among migrants with care-related needs (e.g., parents with children) or access to fewer resources (e.g., social renters and low educational attainment).},

Social exclusion occurs as a result of a series of problems that prevent people from being able to participate in activities that are considered normal in their society.  Some of these problems are related to issues of accessibility. This paper outlines work carried out in the context of the AUNT-SUE (Accessibility and User Needs in Transport in Sustainable Urban Environments) project to develop and model an appropriate set of accessibility benchmarks for older people.  Results confirmed that the travel patterns of older people are very different from those of the average person in the UK and that it was necessary to tailor accessibility benchmarks to the characteristics of this group.  A set of benchmarks was developed based on ability to undertake different types of activity.  These benchmarks are currently being incorporated into AMELIA, a GIS-based tool for assessing the effect of different policy actions on accessibility.  Issues that have arisen include how to model the myriad micro-level circumstances that affect the mobility of older people.  Some initial analysis has shown that these details can make a substantial difference to the assessment of the accessibility of a destination.  Examples are drawn from St Albans in Hertfordshire, UK.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

One reason for this is the emergence of user-generated geographic information, which partially represents subjective everyday geographical encounters. No consensus, however, on how to deal with place in GIScience has yet been reached. This paper presents a systematic literature review providing an overview of how parts of the GIScience community currently use the concept of place as it is understood in human geography. The results suggest that most place related GIScience scholars refer to the humanistic tradition of geography focusing on the essence of experiences of place. Further, it is found that geotagged data published online are a major driver of place-based research, whereas scientific data (e.g., surveys) are less commonly found in respective papers. Many researchers make use of exploratory approaches, which may reflect the early stage at which place-based GIScience research still sits. We also identify a difference between the approach core members of GIScience take and those working on the edge of the field. Thereby, the former often work more conceptually than the latter. The results of this preliminary review inform the current GIScience discourse on place by important evidence about the intellectual standpoints of GIScience scholars, thus fostering future research into place.},

Infrastructure designated for visitor use (i.e., roads, trails) contributed most to models of visitor distribution for all years and seasons. During the spring months, elevation was also a top contributing variable to the model. Crowdsourced data provided empirical assessments of covariates associated with visitor distributions, highlighting how changes in infrastructure and environmental factors may influence visitor use, and therefore resource pressures, to help researchers, managers, and planners with efforts to mitigate negative impacts.},

Identifiers like ``Downtown'' or ``The grim area around the docks'' are part of a vernacular geographical terminology which is vastly more used than the coordinate systems and scientifically defined variables so beloved of professional geographers. These terms not only identify areas, but give members of our sociolinguistic group information about them, building up a jointly-defined cultural world-view within which we all act on a daily basis. Despite its importance for policy making and quality of life, attention is rarely paid to this vernacular geography because it is so hard to capture and use. This paper presents a new set of tools for capturing these ``fuzzy'' psychogeographical areas and their associated attributes, through a web based mapping system. The system contains a spraycan tool that allows users to tag information onto diffuse areas of varying density. An example of their use to define areas people consider are ``high crime'' within a UK city is also presented, along with users' responses to the system. Such a system aims to pull together professional and popular geographical understanding, to the advantage of both.},

The PLATIAL'18 workshop makes a significant contribution towards establishing a notion of place and is meant to be the starting point for a series of future events. What sets this workshop apart from others dealing with the concept of place is that the focus is decisively on its quantitative investigation and conceptual formalization. The workshop accommodates a wide range of aspects all of which in one or another way are related to the two outlined core foci. This is well reflected by the various topical sessions into which the workshop has been organized. These include ``Conceptual Anatomy of Place'', ``Disclosing Places from Human Discourse'', ``Bridging Space and Place'', and ``Exploratory and Visual Analytics of Place''.

  abstract = {Abstract: Existing urban boundaries are usually defined by government agencies for administrative, economic, and political purposes. However, it is not clear whether the boundaries truly reflect human interactions with urban space in intraand inter-regional activities. Defining urban boundaries that consider socioeconomic relationships and citizen commute patterns is important for many aspects of urban and regional planning. In this paper, we describe a method to delineate urban boundaries based upon human interactions with physical space inferred from social media. Specifically, we depicted the urban boundaries of Great Britain using a mobility network of Twitter user spatial interactions, which was inferred from over 69 million geo-located tweets. We define the nonadministrative anthropographic boundaries in a hierarchical fashion based on different physical movement ranges of users derived from the collective mobility patterns of Twitter users in Great Britain. The results of strongly connected urban regions in the form of communities in the network space yield geographically cohesive, non-overlapping urban areas, which provide a clear delineation of the non-administrative anthropographic urban boundaries of Great Britain. The method was applied to both national (Great Britain) and municipal scales (the London metropolis). While our results corresponded well with the administrative boundaries, many unexpected and interesting boundaries were identified. Importantly, as the depicted urban boundaries exhibited a strong instance of spatial proximity, we employed a gravity model to understand the distance decay effects in shaping the delineated urban boundaries. The model explains how geographical distances found in the mobility patterns affect the interaction intensity among different non-administrative anthropographic urban areas, which provides new insights into human spatial interactions with urban space.},

Many techniques have been proposed for processing, managing, and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the major research into               trajectory data mining               , providing a panorama of the field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections, correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally, some public trajectory datasets are presented. This survey can help shape the field of               trajectory data mining               , providing a quick understanding of this field to the community.},

  abstract = {Locations, e.g., countries, states, cities, and point-of-interests, are central to news, emergency events, and people's daily lives. Automatic identification of locations associated with or mentioned in documents has been explored for decades. As one of the most popular online social network platforms, Twitter has attracted a large number of users who send millions of tweets on daily basis. Due to the world-wide coverage of its users and real-time freshness of tweets, location prediction on Twitter has gained significant attention in recent years. Research efforts are spent on dealing with new challenges and opportunities brought by the noisy, short, and context-rich nature of tweets. In this survey, we aim at offering an overall picture of location prediction on Twitter. Specifically, we concentrate on the prediction of user home locations, tweet locations, and mentioned locations. We first define the three tasks and review the evaluation metrics. By summarizing Twitter network, tweet content, and tweet context as potential inputs, we then structurally highlight how the problems depend on these inputs. Each dependency is illustrated by a comprehensive review of the corresponding strategies adopted in state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we also briefly review two related problems, i.e., semantic location prediction and point-of-interest recommendation. Finally, we make a conclusion of the survey and list future research directions.},
